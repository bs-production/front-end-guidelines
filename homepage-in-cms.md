3. Cut each homepage section from your borders file and paste into the appropriate custom code module in your new home page.
    ***UPDATE: Due to a flooky bug that causes the first custom code module to disapper... To edit a custom code module, select Page Modules from the right sidebar and click the module you would like to edit.***
4. Save your page and Rejoice!
