The audio and video html 5 tag has support from IE 9 and up and really good support on mobile. You can use these tags if we canâ€™t use a third party to host the media like YouTube. 

#Audio 

    <audio src="filename.mp3"></audio>

##Audio Attributes 

    autoplay
    controls="controls"

#Video Tag 

    <video src="filename.mp4" autoplay poster="posterimage.jpg"></video>

Please make sure all of the videos you embed are .mp4 before uploading them in the CMS.
