Design & Branding Guidelines

Keep designs clean and minimal. Create a cohesive design that is based on the company‚Äôs brand assets:

- Logo
- Company colors
- Current website (if its good üòÉ)
- Branded vehicles
- Photos

**If the dealer‚Äôs existing site has a full-width (browser window width) main message, create a full-width main message for the site you are building.**


1. Images
  - Use high quality images that appropriately convey the company and services
    - In Photoshop: always convert large, hi-res images, logos, or assets to ‚Äòsmart objects‚Äô to preserve the original quality when revisions need to be made
    - In Photoshop: use layer masks to crop your images to preserve image data in case photos need to be cropped differently in the future
  - Use discretion when applying filters, effects or editing photos
  - Use dealer photos whenever possible
    - Finished project shots
    - Team photos
    - Branded vehicles 
  - Use images of homes that are representative of the location
  - If the company is an Owens Corning contractor - use the approved Pink Panther/Contrator elements according to the branding guidelines located on the graphics drive:
    /graphics/*Working Files/Web Design/Library/01 Credibility/Owens Corning
