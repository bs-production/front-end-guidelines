##Adding a New Account 

What do you do when you head over to GA to add your site and go to “Create New Property” but find the lovely text “50 out of 50"?

In the past you cried out for John and hoped he had the answer. Or maybe you spent 20 minutes opening up sites to find an old site you could delete.

No more! Thanks to Josh “The IT Slayer” Gister we now know how to create our own accounts. 


1. Go to Account Menu and select “Create New Account”. Note: On the next screen make sure the “Website” button at top is active 
2. Set your “Account Name” – example “Contractor Nation 7354"
3. You can’t create an account without adding a site into that account. So let’s add your site under “Website Name” and “Website URL”  (www.mysiteisawesome.com)
4. “Industry”:  can be left alone
5. “Time Zone”: Eastern 
6. Leave the checkmarks alone
7. Hit the “Get Tracking ID” button 
8. Whistle
9. Smile
10. Enjoy the rest of your day
