***2. Images***
  - Use high quality images that appropriately convey the company and services and compress the final .jpg or .png.
    - In Photoshop: always convert large, hi-res images, logos, or assets to ‚Äòsmart objects‚Äô to preserve the original quality when revisions need to be made

    - Finished project shots
    - Team photos
    - Branded vehicles
