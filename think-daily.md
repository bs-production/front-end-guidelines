#Think Daily Headers


Creating Headers

Welcome to the wonderful world of creating email headers for Think Daily (& Think Daily for Businesspeople). We, and by we I mean you, are going to have a lot of fun creating hundreds of header images!

Before you create your headers:
Go through the images you’ve been given by a project manager (or some other random person that was lucky enough to receive the images). Make sure they are all categorized properly and that the categories make some sense. Don’t be the guy that puts an image of the presidents daughter in the Animals category. Not saying anybody here did that already... 

The image categories that can be used are broken out in the tabs here: 
http://www.larryjanesky.com/admin/headers.php

Use any image category except for “default”. 

Once that’s done you can get into the fun part. Creating the header!


What you’ll need:
- Photoshop (for making)
- Bridge (for batch renaming)
- Garamond Regular (for wording)
- Verdana Regular (for more wording)
- A web browser (for uploading)
- Patience (for sanity)
- Coffee (for staying awake)

So there’s a template file here:
/*Working Files/Web Design/01 Projects/Janesky Projects/TD Header Production Template/larryjanesky-email-header-.psd

Find it. Copy it. Love it. Do not alter the original file or it’s name. The file prefix is specific to the regular Think Daily header so we are going to make those images first.

Open the file in Photoshop and get familiar with the structure of the layer names. These names are critical and if you mess something up you’re likely to get fired. No pressure. 

The top layer should be named “default td-header/”. This is for asset generation. We’ll come back to this later.

Next you’ll see a folder with a long name. All individual images must go in a similar folder following this structure so just copy it as needed. You’ll end up with a large PSD file filled with tons of folders. Fun!

The folder naming convention is:
[abstract]-[water-young-girl-daughter].jpg10
[image category]-[detailed-file-name].jpg10

Don’t leave off the .jpg10 - it’s used for asset generation and tells PS to export a jpeg at 100% quality.

Don’t use the same names for images. It will cause problems when you upload and then you’ll have to beg Josh to help you fix things. 

Inside this folder you’ll see the “text templates” folder. This contains the Think Daily & Think Daily Business head logos. There’s a stacked and long version for each so use whichever works best with your image.

There are also some layer effects for drop shadows and glows. Use them if you need them. 

Once you have all the images set up it’s time for some magic.
Save your file before doing this. Seriously. You do not want to mess this part up. 

In the menu bar go to File > Generate > and select Image Assets. If everything is working PS will create a jpeg for every folder you made. The jpegs will be in an assets folder normally found wherever you kept the PSD file (sometimes it defaults to creating a new folder on your desktop). The assets folder will be named “your-file-name-assets” and the magical “td-header” folder (the top layer name in your PS doc) will be created in there with all assets.

Once that’s done turn off Generate Image Assets by going through the menu again. Then save your file. If you don’t turn it off every time you open the file it will generate assets.  

Now create a copy of your PSD file and change the name to larryjanesky-bemail-header-.psd


- This next batch of assets is for TD Business only.
- First, we have to change the top layer name to “default tdb-header/”.
- Then go through and change the logo on each image to the Think Daily for Businesspeople  head.
- Once done updating the logo just repeat the above steps for generating assets. 

For those that forgot or don’t want to scroll up:

- Save file.
- Turn on File > Generate > Image Assets. Get coffee.
- These images should be generated in a separate asset folder specific for this file. Again, magic creates the folder “tdb-header”.


Now we open up Adobe Bridge to help batch rename all of the files.

In bridge, navigate to the “td-folder” using the folder browser and highlight it. To the right you should see the images inside that folder. Click in that panel, scroll through, make sure all images look great and then:


- Select all images and right click. 
- Choose “Batch Rename”. 

In the pop-up select the following:

- Destination: Rename in same folder
- Under New Filenames set the first dropdown to “Text” and type (or copy) “larryjanesky-email-header-”
- then set the next row of dropdowns to “Current Filename”, “Name”, “Original Case”.

The preview at the bottom of the window shows the filename structure so just double-check it looks good and then hit “Rename”.

A proper filename will look like:
larryjanesky-email-header-category-really-descriptive-image-title.jpg

Once done, repeat the same process for the images in your “tdb-header” folder.
The only difference is:
Under New Filenames set the first dropdown to “Text” and type “larryjanesky-bemail-header-”.

Double check all the images again (you can use bridge, mac file browser or PS file browser, your choice!) and make sure files still look perfect and nothing got corrupted. You do not want to upload a bad file. Bad files make for bad email headers make for angry presidents. 


Now we’re ready to upload!

Here are 3 links to help with the upload process & verifying everything is working. 
http://www.larryjanesky.com/admin/upload_images.php - uploading images
http://www.larryjanesky.com/admin/headers.php - checking TD images
http://www.larryjanesky.com/admin/bheaders.php - checking TDB images

Open all 3 links to make life easier. 
The uploader is...a little..finicky so try not to miss a step or, you guessed it, you have to get Josh to fix things.

A few uploading guidelines. 

- Only upload one batch of headers at a time so not to confuse things. ie only TD headers.
- Upload one category of images at a time to make the process easier. ie only Animals.
- Make sure there are no problem images (corrupt, bad file name, etc) before you upload them. 

What do I do if Josh has to remove a problem file for whatever reason?!?!
Change your file name when you upload a new image. If you keep the same file name you’ll get an error and guess what...Josh will not be happy with you. So don’t do it. Just add a number or another word or rev or something to your file name.

So let’s start with the regular Think Daily images first (td-header folder).

1. Click “Add files” button and navigate to your folder.
2. Select files to upload. I upload only one category at a time (like animals) to make the next steps easier. There’s a limit to how many files can be uploaded at once…I don’t remember it. It may be 25 files. Hopefully you don’t encounter the file limit it because you’ll need Josh to fix any problems if you do. 
  One potential problem: only some of your images will get uploaded but the file names will register as being uploaded for the rest of your images. 
  The fix: change your file names when you upload new images.
3. Step 3 - Click “Start Upload” button (right next to “Add Files”)
4. Step 4 - Once files are uploaded choose “Type: Think Daily” and hit Send.

A new screen will load and now you choose the image category. Since we (hopefully) uploaded only one category you can use the upper dropdown menu to select the proper category. This will apply a bulk change to all images in this batch. 

Alternatively, you can upload multiple image categories but then you have to manually change the category for each image individually. Not something you would enjoy if you’ve uploaded more than 2-3 images. 

Now hit send and go to the link listed above that is for “checking TD images”. Refresh the page and choose the category you just uploaded. Check to make sure your uploaded images are there and look good. If everything is perfect, move on to next step.

If something looks wrong, Josh to the rescue. 

Now you’ve probably found another quirk in the uploader. There’s no Back button. Oh no!
Just click the original link for the uploader to get back to the beginning. Don’t refresh. You will break something if you do. 

Repeat the process for all remaining regular TD image categories.

Then you can do the TDB images. 
The only difference is:
Step 4 - Once files are uploaded choose “Type: Think Daily for Businesspeople” and hit Send.

Make sure you always set the Type for TDB images. It doesn’t save that option and resets to Think Daily each time you go back to starting page. If you upload to the wrong directory….this is getting old and I’m sure you can guess who will need to help you…yup..Josh.

Now…you are a header master. Good luck!
